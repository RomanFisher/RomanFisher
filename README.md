### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend developer specializing in PHP, with a versatile skill set that extends to front-end technologies like HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. Alongside my expertise in backend development, I'm adept at crafting responsive and visually appealing user interfaces that enhance the overall user experience.

My educational background includes graduating from the Polytechnic College and currently pursuing further studies at the Lublin University of Technology, where I continue to deepen my knowledge of programming and software development. I've supplemented my academic pursuits with practical experience gained during an internship at Rexsoft, where I delved into the intricacies of backend development.

In addition to my proficiency in PHP, I'm skilled in languages like C++, C#, and JavaScript, enabling me to tackle diverse programming challenges with confidence. I'm also experienced in designing and implementing databases using tools like PHPMyAdmin, SQL Workbench and Microsoft Access, ensuring the efficiency and scalability of applications.

With a passion for software development and a thirst for new challenges, I'm eager to collaborate with dynamic teams on innovative projects that push the boundaries of what's possible. Whether it's backend development, front-end design, or database management, I'm committed to delivering high-quality solutions that meet and exceed project requirements.
