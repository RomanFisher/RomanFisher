I've supplemented my academic pursuits with practical experience gained during an internship at Rexsoft, where I delved into the intricacies of backend development.

In addition to my proficiency in PHP, I'm skilled in languages like C++, C#, and JavaScript, enabling me to tackle diverse programming challenges with confidence. I'm also experienced in designing and implementing databases using tools like PHPMyAdmin, SQL Workbench and Microsoft Access, ensuring the efficiency and scalability of applications.

With a passion for software development and a thirst for new challenges, I'm eager to collaborate with dynamic teams on innovative projects that push the boundaries of what's possible. Whether it's backend development, front-end design, or database management, I'm committed to delivering high-quality solutions that meet and exceed project requirements.
